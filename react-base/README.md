# REACT BASE FOR GENERIC PROJECTS

## In this project you will find:

- Vercel CLI for easy deploy
- Premade hamburger menu
- React Icons
- A premade contact form with validation. It works with EmailJS. Set up the emailJS variables in a .env file at root of project.
- SCSS (make sure you have the Watch Sass Extension on VSCode to use SASS, if you want to use it.)
- Webpack as the bundler
